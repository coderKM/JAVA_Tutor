It’s a great time for Data Mining and it’s making a significant impact on business
??? ???????? ?! ?? ??, ????? ??? ??? ??
– Increased credibility due to many reference qualifications
  ??? ???? ??? ?????? ??????? 
– Tremendous business interest in fully exploiting and leveraging process data for all it’s worth

 
– Huge volumes of data
?  ??? ??? ? : make cluster more clear and more possibility to find more cluster patterns
 Scaling up the impact of Data Mining
– Automation
  ??? : to mine and cluster datas more efficiently
 – Integration with business application
   ???? ??? ?? ?? : aims more closely to the typical analytics stack in a business  
• Decision Support and Optimization
   : support decision and optimize the decision 

• Data Management
• Dashboards / Portals
• Application Deployment Architectures
– Scalability

[ Algorithm idea ] 
??? ??? ?? ????? ??? ?? ????? cluster? ???? ??

- k-means clustering
  with using partition, divide given data into several groups
  -> incresing in similarity between datas in a group
  -> algorithm divide the group through the way :
    - minimize the sum of squere of the distance between the central point of group and datas in the group
  -> n datas
     1. divide datas into the k number of sets (k =< n) 
     2. the purpose is to find the set S which has the least value of :
	sum of squere of the distance from central to each datas
     2. when data size = n, proper number of k = square root of (n/2)
