- Waterfall Model
	1 => program specification
		2 => design
			3 => Implementation
				4 => Testing
					5 => Maintenance

- Types of error
  * Compile-time error => occurs during compilation
  * Syntax error => compile-time error caused by violating the rule of language
  * Runtime error => occurs during execution of the program
  * intent or logic error => one that fails to carry out the specification

- Design in OO(object-oriented) language
   1) Identify class
   2) Identify behaivor(method, etc)
   3) Determine relationship with classes
   4) Write interface and implements

- Determining relationship between Classes
   * Inheritance => "is-a" relationship / sub-class points to super-class with an empty arrow
	ex) Civic [is a] car
   * Composition => "has-a" relationship / owner-class points to another with a black arrow
        ex) Car [has an] engine 

- Helper Method => Method that avoids repeated code (ex. swap, search, etc.)

- Method stub => dummy method that stands in for a method until the actual method has been written and tested

- Collaboratos => Classes needed to implement for particular methods
   * Classes with no collaborators are called independent
