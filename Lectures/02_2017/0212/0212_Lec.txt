[ Coding! ]
 1)
 - You want to make a class(Calc) with two instance variables :
   - int _i; int _j;
   - these variable will be taken throgh parameters
 - And you want to make an interface(Operator) with 4 methods :
   - int sum(), int sub(), int div(), int mul()
 - Implement Operator to Calc class & complete the function

 2) Same as above BUT!
 - You are not sure how to define sum() method..
 - So, you have to make an abstract class

 3) complete method int playWithString(String s, int i)
 - when i = 0, it refers to an alphabet a (when i = 1, alphabet b...)
 - you should return how many alphabet(that i refer to) does s contain.
 - ex) s = banana, i = 0(a) => return : 3
