[ Lecture ]
- What is recursion? Do you guys still remember?
(http://www.russia-ex.com/images/blog/Matryoshka-Dolls-1.jpg)
- NO CODE, only multiple choices! YAY!!
- Base case or termination condition => method to end
- nonbase case => move the algorithm toward the basecase
- Think about base case FIRST! then, nonbase
- Let's look at factorial example
  ㄴ how would you make ur factorial method?
  ㄴ let's see the table on pg 293
  ㄴ what is difference?
- General Rules
  * Avoid recursion for algorithm that involve large local array => cause memory over-flow
  * Use it when it significantly simplifies code
  * Avoid recursion for simple iterative methods
  * especially useful for tree functions & divide-and-conquer algorithm

[ Code(Eclipse) ]
- int add(int input) => recursively calculate the sum of 0,1,2,...,input
- void recPrint(int[] input) => recursively print elements of  arr in reverse
- int recFactorial(int n) => receursively calculate the factorial value
