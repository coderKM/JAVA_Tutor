    ㄴ For an array of n elements, the array is sorted after n-1 passes
    ㄴ After the kth pass, the first k elements are in their final sorted position
  * Insertion Sort
    ㄴ move elemtns from the unsorted list to the sorted list one at a time

    ㄴ For an array of n elements, the array is sorted after n-1 passes
    ㄴ The worst case would be the array is initially sorted in reverse order
    ㄴ The best case would be the array sorted in increasing order
    ㄴ After kth pass, array[0] ~ array[k] are sorted with respect to each other
  * Merge Sort
    ㄴ Sort with recursion, called *Divide-and-conquer*
    ㄴ How it works?
       1. Break the array into two halves
       2. Mergesort the lefthalf
       3. Mergesort the righthalf
       4. Merge the two subarrays into a sorted array
